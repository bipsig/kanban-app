# Kanban Board App

A Kanban board app built using React, where you can manage tasks across different lists. Perform Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) operations on the cards, and enjoy the flexibility of draggable components powered by React Draggable. Tasks can be easily organized by dragging them from one list to another.
